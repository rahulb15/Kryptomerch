                Providers to offer You Products that You can customize with Your
                Content and sell to Customers. We also maintain and create
                integrations with different Sales Channels so that Your Products
                can be easily published to your customers. When Your Products
                are purchased by Customers through a Sales Channel, We are
                notified and We start working with Providers who will print and
                deliver Your Products to the Customers. If You choose to use the
                Service to sell Your Products, Your relationship to Kryptomerch
                is limited to being that of a consumer and not an employee,
                agent, joint venturer, or partner of Kryptomerch for any reason.
                You act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit,
                and not on behalf or for the benefit, of Kryptomerch. While We
                facilitate the resolution of disputes and provide necessary
                guidelines for the creation of Your Products, Kryptomerch has no
                control over and does not guarantee the final quality of Your
                Product. Nor do we make any promises that Your Product will look
                like Your Mockup. Print Providers differ in their printing
                technology, product offerings, and operations. Users are
                expected to do their own due diligence in selecting the most
                suitable Provider for creating Users’ Products.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Kryptomerch may give You access to link to various external
                resources or third-party services (“Third Party Sites”).
                Kryptomerch does not endorse any of these Third Party Sites and
                does not control them in any manner. These Third Party Sites may
                be governed by their own terms of service and policies.
                Kryptomerch is not liable or responsible for the accuracy of
                such services or their content, or products, and You need to
                take appropriate steps to determine whether accessing a Third
                Party Site is appropriate, and to protect Your personal
                information and privacy on such Third Party Site.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                1. Kryptomerch is not party to any agreement between any users.
                You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity,
                legitimacy, and authenticity of NFTs & Merchandising that you
                purchase from third-party sellers using the Service and we make
                no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or
                authenticity of users or NFTs and Merchandise (and any content
                associated with such NFTs) visible on the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes
                need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such
                services are deemed part of the “Service” hereunder and shall
                also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and
                conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then
                become part of your agreement with us if you use those services.
                In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any
                additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific
                service, such additional terms shall control for that specific
                service.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                3. Kryptomerch reserves the right to change or modify these
                Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we make
                material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts
                to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice
                through the Service or updating the “Last Updated” date at the
                beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the
                Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and
                all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as
                of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole
                responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view
                such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and
                conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                4. Accessing the Service Like much of web3, your blockchain
                address functions as your identity on Kryptomerch. Accordingly,
                you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to
                access the Service. Your account on the service (“Account”) will
                be associated with your blockchain address; however, if you want
                to add some flair to your Kryptomerch persona, you can add
                additional information, such as a profile picture, to your
                Account.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                5. Your Account on Kryptomerch will be associated with your
                linked blockchain address and display the NFTs for that
                blockchain address (and, if applicable, any content associated
                with such NFTs). By using your wallet in connection with the
                Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the
                terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet.
                Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with
                Kryptomerch, and Kryptomerch does not have custody or control
                over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve
                or transfer its contents. Kryptomerch accepts no responsibility
                for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a
                wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how
                the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are
                solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should
                never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone.
                If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact
                your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely responsible for
                your Account and any associated wallet and we are not liable for
                any acts or omissions by you in connection with your Account or
                as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised. You
                agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise
                suspect any security issues related to the Service or your
                Account (you can contact us here).{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                6.You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all
                applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal and other laws)
                when using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by using
                the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not
                located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
                embargo; and (b) you have not been identified as a Specially
                Designated National or placed on any U.S. Government list of
                prohibited, sanctioned, or restricted parties. If you access or
                use the Service outside the United States, you are solely
                responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Service
                in such country, territory or jurisdiction does not violate any
                applicable laws.
              </p>
              <p>
                7. Kryptomerch may require you to provide additional information
                and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request
                of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation
                dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these
                Terms. In such cases, Kryptomerch, in its sole discretion, may
                disable your Account and block your ability to access the
                Service until such additional information and documents are
                processed by Kryptomerch. If you do not provide complete and
                accurate information in response to such a request, Kryptomerch
                may refuse to restore your access to the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from
                time to time for any of several reasons, including, without
                limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating,
                maintenance, or repair of the Service or other actions that
                Kryptomerch, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                9.We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are
                at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use
                Kryptomerch through a parent or guardian’s Account and with
                their approval and oversight. That account holder is responsible
                for your actions using the Account. It is prohibited to use our
                Service if you are under 13 years old.{" "}
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                11. Kryptomerch’s name, logo, trademarks, and any Kryptomerch
                product or service names, designs, logos, and slogans are the
                intellectual property of Kryptomerch or our affiliates or

                Service provided, however, that such license is subject to your

              <h3>Third-Party Content and Services </h3>
              <p>
                As a peer-to-peer web3 service, Kryptomerch helps you explore
                NFTs created by third parties and interact with different
                blockchains. Kryptomerch does not make any representations or
                warranties about this third-party content visible through our
                Service, including any content associated with NFTs displayed on
                the Service, and you bear responsibility for verifying the
                legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs that you purchase
                from third-party sellers. We also cannot guarantee that any NFTs
                visible on Kryptomerch will always remain visible and/or
                available to be bought, sold, or transferred.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers
                with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits
                associated with a given NFT (“Purchase Terms”). For example,
                when you click to get more details about any of the NFTs visible
                on Kryptomerch, you may notice a third party link to the
                creator’s website. Such website may include Purchase Terms
                governing the use of the NFT that you will be required to comply
                with. Kryptomerch is not a party to any such Purchase Terms,
                which are solely between the buyer and the seller. The buyer and
                seller are entirely responsible for communicating,
              </p>
              <p>
                Promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing Purchase Terms. You are
                solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase Terms.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                The Service may also contain links or functionality to access or
                use third-party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and
                applications (“Third-Party Applications”), or otherwise display,
                include, or make available content, data, information, services,
                applications, or materials from third parties (“Third-Party
                Materials”). When you click on a link to, or access and use, a
                Third-Party Website or Third-Party Application, though we may
                not warn you that you have left our Service, you are subject to
                the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another
                website or destination. Such Third-Party Websites, Third-Party
                Applications, and Third-Party Materials are not under the
                control of Kryptomerch, and may be “open” applications for which
                no recourse is possible. Kryptomerch is not responsible or
                liable for any Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications,
                and Third-Party Materials. Kryptomerch provides links to these
                Third-Party Websites and Third-Party Applications only as a
                convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse,
                warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party
                Websites or Third-Party Applications, or their products or
                services or associated Third-Party Materials. You use all links
                in Third-Party Websites, Third-Party Applications, and
                Third-Party Materials at your own risk.

              <h3>Assumption of Risk </h3>
              <p>
                You accept and acknowledge: The value of an NFTs is subjective.
                Prices of NFTs are subject to volatility and fluctuations in the
                price of cryptocurrency can also materially and adversely affect
                NFT prices. You acknowledge that you fully understand this
                subjectivity and volatility and that you may lose money. A lack
                of use or public interest in the creation and development of
                distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development
                of those ecosystems and related applications, and could
                therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs.
                The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies,
                non-fungible tokens, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based
                items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may
                materially adversely affect the development of the Service and
                the utility of NFTs. You are solely responsible for determining
                what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions. Kryptomerch is
                not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your
                NFTs. There are risks associated with purchasing items
                associated with content created by third parties through
                peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the
                risk of purchasing counterfeit items,{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay,
                items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become

                sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain,
                transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or
                accounts/collections. We do not control the public blockchains

                ability to complete transactions on these public blockchains.
                Additionally, blockchain transactions are irreversible and
                Kryptomerch has no ability to reverse any transactions on the
                blockchain. There are risks associated with using Internet and
                blockchain based products, including, but not limited to, the
                risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet
                connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and
                the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to
                your third-party wallet or Account. You accept and acknowledge
                that Kryptomerch will not be responsible for any communication
                failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may
                experience when using the Service or any Blockchain network,
                however caused. The Service relies on third-party platforms
                and/or vendors. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship
                with such platform providers and/or vendors; if the terms and
                conditions or pricing of such platform providers and/or vendors
                change; if we violate or cannot comply with the terms and
                conditions of such platforms and/or vendors; or if any of such
                platforms and/or vendors loses market share or falls out of
                favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access
                to and use of the Service will suffer. Kryptomerch reserves the
                right to hide collections, contracts, and items affected by any
                of these issues or by other issues. Items you purchase may
                become inaccessible on Kryptomerch. Under no circumstances shall
                the inability to view items on Kryptomerch or an inability to
                use the Service in conjunction with the purchase, sale, or
                transfer of items available on any blockchains serve as grounds
                for a claim against Kryptomerch. If you have a dispute with one
                or more users, YOU RELEASE US FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES

                Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or

                disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from
                consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal
                injury claims.

                Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information about how we
                collect, use, and share personal data about you. By submitting
                personal data through our Service, you agree to the terms of our
                Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use,
                and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with the

                Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Please read
                the following arbitration agreement in this Section
                (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It requires you to
                arbitrate disputes with Kryptomerch and limits the manner in
                which you can seek relief from us. This section does not govern
                disputes between users or between users and third parties.
                Kryptomerch does not provide dispute resolution services for
                such disagreements and the parties must resolve those disputes
                directly. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that
                any dispute, controversy, or claim relating in any way to your
                access or use of the Service, to any products sold or
                distributed through the Service, or to any aspect of your
                relationship with Kryptomerch, will be resolved by binding
                arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold questions
                of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim
                except that (1) you or Kryptomerch may assert claims in small
                claims court, but only if the claims qualify, the claims remain
                only in such court, and the claims remain on an individual,
                non-representative, and non-class basis; and (2) you or
                Kryptomerch may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court
                of proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual
                property infringement or other misuse of intellectual property
                rights. Dispute resolution process. You and Kryptomerch both
                agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior
                to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court
                proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property
                infringement. You must initiate this dispute resolution process
                by sending a letter describing the nature of your claim and
                desired resolution to: Kryptomerch, Attn: Legal Department, 228
                Park Avenue South, #22014, New York, NY 10003. Both parties
                agree to{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference
                (hereinafter “Conference”) to discuss the dispute and attempt in
                good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids
                the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If
                you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in
                the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in
                the Conference. Likewise, if Kryptomerch is represented by
                counsel, its counsel may participate in the Conference as well,
                but Kryptomerch agrees to have a company representative fully
                participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and
                any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties
                engage in the informal dispute resolution process and Conference
                required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach
                agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after
                initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may
                commence arbitration, file an action in small claims court, or
                file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of
                proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual
                property infringement, if the claims qualify.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs
                the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
                Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after
                participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a
                letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our
                registered agent at Kryptomerch, Attn: Legal Department, 228

                The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
                alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving
                claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of
                attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most
                current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the
                JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims
                shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
                Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS
                Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS’s rules are
                available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If
                JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an
                alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you
                cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing,
                and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS,
                Kryptomerch will pay them for you if you complied with the
                dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition,
                Kryptomerch will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative,
                hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000
                unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you
                did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth
                above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim,
                you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the
                maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration
                claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all
                additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including
                without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or
                videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your
                hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another
                mutually agreed upon location that is reasonably convenient to
                you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
                entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Authority of
                Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a)
                determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration
                Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the
                interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of
                this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any
                claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void
                or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and
                liabilities, if any, of you and Kryptomerch. The arbitration
                proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or
                joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall
                have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part
                of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award
                monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
                available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral
                forum’s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a
                written award and statement of decision describing the essential
                findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including
                the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the
                same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a
                judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator
                is final and binding upon you and us. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU
                AND KRYPTOMERCH HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY
                RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A
                JURY. You and Kryptomerch are instead electing that all claims
                and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this
                Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the second bullet
                of this Section 16, above (“Applicability of Arbitration
                Agreement”). An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
                same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms
                as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in
                arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject
                to very limited review. Waiver of Class Actions and Class
                Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
                ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS
                AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY
                INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
                USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED
                WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly,
                under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an
                arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one
                party’s claims without the written consent of all affected
                parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the
                generality of the foregoing, you and Kryptomerch agree that no
                dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the
                written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued
                stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of
                this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief,
                then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought
                in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the
                State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.
                Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or
                parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to
                be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts
                shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the
                remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full
                force and effect. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration
                Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with
                Kryptomerch. Modification.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we
                agree that if Kryptomerch makes any future material change to
                this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within
                thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to
                Kryptomerch at the following address: Kryptomerch, Attn: Legal

              <h3>Governing Law and Venue </h3>
              <p>
                These Terms and your access to and use of the Service shall be
                governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
                laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law
                rules or principles of the State of New York, or any other
                jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any
                other jurisdiction). Any dispute between the parties that is not
                subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 16 or cannot be
                heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or
                federal courts of New York County in the State of New York, and
                the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New

              <h3>Termination</h3>

                If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses
                granted by Kryptomerch will terminate automatically.
                Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms,
                we reserve the right, with or without notice and in our sole
                discretion, to suspend, disable, terminate, or delete your
                Account and/or your ability to access or use the Service (or any
                part of the foregoing) at any time and for any or no reason, and
                you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or
                obligation to you in such event and that you will not be
                entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid
                to us.{" "}
              </p>
              <h3>Severability</h3>
              <p>
                If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid

              <h3>How do Payments Work on Kryptomerch?</h3>
              <p>
                Summary: Kryptomerch will only charge you fees if you placed an
                order of Merchandising. No products are produced or shipped
                unless payment for those products has first been received via
                credit/debit, Crypto payments or from an existing Kryptomerch
                balance. Users have the option to change settings for when and
                how often they are charged. You cannot withdraw “sales credits”
                or “subscription bonus”.Unless Users subscribe to the
                Kryptomerch Premium Plan, there are no fees or charges for the
                platform itself. You must pay for the Order in advance. The
                price You pay will be the price of the Product plus shipping and
                taxes (if applicable). These prices can be found in the
                Kryptomerch Catalog and on our ShippingRates page. Orders will
                not be processed until payment has been received by Kryptomerch
                Kryptomerch cannot pull funds that You may have available in
                your wallet. In order to process payments on Kryptomerch, You
                need to either have a Credit/Debit card/ Crypto payment on file
                or connect Kryptomerch to your PayPal account. By default,
                Kryptomerch will charge funds for Orders from an existing
                Kryptomerch balance first, and if there is a remaining balance
                due then Kryptomerch will charge any saved Credit or Debit
                cards. Kryptomerch charges Users when Orders are sent to
                production. Users have the option to change their settings to
                adjust how often Orders are sent to production and whether
                Kryptomerch charges per Order or for multiple Orders together.
                These settings can be found here, after You create an account
                and connect a Sales Channel. Kryptomerch may issue a coupon. A
                coupon is virtual money that can be used for paying for manual
                and sample orders. You may use a coupon only for a single order.
                Multiple coupons cannot be combined. Each coupon’s value is
                divided according to the total line items in the order. It
                cannot be converted to cash or withdrawn.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have an issue with your order, contact Kryptomerch before
                disputing your claim with your credit card company. If you have
                filed a dispute with your credit card company, we will not be
                able to issue you a refund as well, and we cannot make any
                refunds or replacements until the dispute is resolved or
                cancelled. If there are Order issues and after an investigation
                Kryptomerch offers you a refund, this will be provided in the
                form of a Kryptomerch credit and will appear in your Kryptomerch
                balance. Once a user withdraws funds from Kryptomerch balance it
                will be sent to the same payment source where it initially came
                from, whether it is a credit/debit card/Crypto or a PayPal
                account. If a top-up is made via PayPal, withdrawal can only be
                made to the same PayPal account. In case the initial payment was
                made with a card, the Kryptomerch balance withdrawal will take
                place in the form of a credit/debit card full or partial refund.
                Subscription bonus provided to subscribers of the Kryptomerch
                Premium Plan will not be able to be withdrawn. Users are
                responsible for paying any necessary sales tax on their
                transactions. Because of the nature of dropshipping businesses,
                taxes differ depending on who produces or sells the Product, and
                where it is delivered. Kryptomerch recommends that You consult
                with an outside tax accountant.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                European Union (EU) regulations require Kryptomerch to collect
                Value Added Tax (“VAT”) on all orders produced and shipped
                within the EU. Users with businesses registered with the EU may
                apply for a VAT Exemption if the Users have a valid VAT number.
                If you qualify for a VAT exemption, contact Kryptomerch Sales
                Support with your VAT number and business details and we will
                apply the exemption in our system.{" "}

              <h3>How Does Kryptomerch Handle Order Related Issues?</h3>
              <p>
                Summary: If you have an issue with your order, contact
                Kryptomerch directly within 30 days of product delivery and
                provide a detailed description of your issue, accompanied by
                relevant photo or video evidence that support your case. After
                investigation, we will determine if you are eligible to receive
                a replacement at no cost to you. Some issues do not qualify for
                replacement, they are outlined below. Kryptomerch does not hold
                any inventory and does not perform any of the printing itself.
                Other than issues caused by technical error, we are not
                responsible for the quality and outcome of Produced Orders. The
                quality of the production is dependent on the selected Provider.
                Each Provider has their own tools and procedures and Users are
                expected to perform their own research when selecting a
                Provider, as well as submitting Content that satisfies the
                provided print quality requirements.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if your order has issues, steps for resolution are
                outlined below. Kryptomerch’s Sales Support team handles all
                conflict resolution on behalf of our Providers. Users agree to
                contact Kryptomerch Sales Support for all conflict resolution.
                If the Produced Order does not meet User or Customer
                expectations, Users must first contact Kryptomerch sales Support
                within 30 days of product delivery and will not contact the
                Print Providers. In order to best resolve the matter, the User
                should provide all relevant materials for Kryptomerch to
                investigate the issue, including a description of the Produced
                Order, the issue, and quantity of Products affected. If a User
                contacts the Provider directly, the User risks account
                suspension at Kryptomerch’s sole discretion Products are unique
                and produced to order, therefore, they are non-refundable and
                cannot be cancelled. Once an Order has been sent to production
                it is sent to the Provider and the User can no longer edit the
                details of the Order or cancel it. If the shipment details are
                incorrect, or the Customer ordered the wrong size or color,
                Kryptomerch is not responsible and will not offer replacements
                or refunds. The User is responsible for relaying the correct
                information from the User’s Customers. Users may adjust the
                settings for when an Order is sent to production.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Orders for products with recently updated artwork go through a
                Kryptomerch Quality Control process that checks for
                low-resolution imagery or any other design related issues. If an
                issue is discovered, Kryptomerch will send saless an email
                explaining the issue and any possible product quality
                repercussions. If You choose to proceed with the order, or if
                Kryptomerch does not receive a response within 7 days of the
                email notification, the order will be submitted and You will not
                be eligible for any replacements or refunds for this order.
                Orders that don’t meet other criteria of Kryptomerch’s Terms of
                Service or Intellectual Property Policy will be cancelled, and
                charges refunded. The Production times listed on the Website are
                estimated average times and are in no way guaranteed. If Your
                Order seems to be taking an unusually long time to be produced
                or delivered, please contact Kryptomerch’s sales Support team.
                If the Produced Order is lost during Shipment, Kryptomerch will
                investigate and may provide replacements when appropriate. After
                investigating Your issue, if Kryptomerch’s sales Support team
                determines that your Product is faulty, Your Orders will be
                submitted for either reprint or replacement. Refunds are only
                provided if a subsequent reprint or replacement is also found to
                be faulty by our sales Support team. Refunds will be issued in
                the form of credits to Your Kryptomerch balance.{" "}

                Kryptomerch does not give refunds for orders that have been
                shipped without tracking until they are verified to be lost. If
                an order is returned to Kryptomerch due to an incorrect address,
                the User will be contacted by Kryptomerch sales Support to
                arrange a reshipment. The User will be liable for the reshipment
                costs once an updated address is provided and confirmed.
                Otherwise, packages will be donated after one week if
                Kryptomerch sales Support is not provided with a valid address
                for the reshipment. Reshipment costs include the original
                shipping cost of the product and a service fee of $4. The
                service fee covers any Charge On Delivery (C.O.D) fees that we
                get charged by the fulfillment operator and handling fees. If an
                order has not been delivered in 30 calendar days (for domestic
                US or regional EU orders) or in 45 calendar days (for
                international orders), saless should contact Kryptomerch sales
                Support within 1 week in order to be eligible for a
                reprint/refund.{" "}

              <h3>Kryptomerch Premium Subscription Plan </h3>
              <p>
                Summary: Kryptomerch has a monthly and yearly subscription plan
                that offers up to a 10% discount on all products. Both of these
                plans auto-renew and do not cancel if you uninstall the
                Kryptomerch app or disconnect your store. You have to cancel,
                before the renewal date.
              </p>
              <h3>Recurring Subscription </h3>
              <p>
                By subscribing to the Kryptomerch Premium Plan, you will receive
                discounts of up to 10% on all Kryptomerch products and the
                subscription will continue month-to-month or year-to-year until
                cancellation or termination. You must cancel your subscription
                before it renews each month/year in order to avoid billing for
                the next subscription period. Upon subscription, You will
                receive a one-time only bonus credit that will be applied to
                your Kryptomerch Balance. This bonus will not be reapplied the
                following month or year, nor will it apply if you unsubscribe
                and resubscribe, or change your subscription plan. The bonus
                credit will be applied to your next customer or sample orders.
                Before you subscribe to the Premium plan, you will be able to
                preview and compare both prices. After subscribing, the Premium
                plan prices will be the only prices displayed to you throughout
                the catalog. All visible prices from this point forward will
                have the Premium plan discount applied. Billing By starting your
                subscription, you authorize us to charge you a full subscription
                fee. You acknowledge that the amount charged may vary from time
                to time for reasons that may include promotional offers, or
                changes in subscription plan. You authorize us to charge your
                payment card for these amounts. Kryptomerch reserves the right
                to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in
                any manner and at any time as we may determine in sole and
                absolute discretion. Any price changes to your service will take
                effect following a notice by email to you. You will be charged
                for the subscription fee immediately and the charges will
                auto-renew every month for monthly subscriptions and every year
                for yearly subscriptions unless you cancel the subscription. We
                automatically charge your payment card every month or every year
                on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your
                subscription. We reserve the right to change the timing of the
                charge if your payment card has been declined. In the event your
                subscription is started on a day not contained in a given month,
                we will charge your payment card on a day we deem appropriate.
                For example, if your subscription started on August 31, we will
                likely charge the next fee on September 30. In case you switch
                from a monthly (not cancelled) to a yearly subscription, your
                monthly subscription will be terminated immediately and the
                yearly subscription will be activated starting from the
                switching date. The amount charged for unused days within your
                monthly subscription will be proportionally deducted from the
                yearly subscription fee. For instance, if you switch from a
                monthly to an yearly subscription plan halfway through the
                month, you will be charged the yearly subscription, $299.88,
                minus the sum for unused days in the month, in this case $14.5
                (half of the month), which means the billed amount will be
                $285.38. In case you switch from a monthly (cancelled) but still
                active to a yearly subscription, your monthly subscription will
                be terminated immediately and the yearly subscription will be
                activated starting from the switching date. However, the full
                amount of $299.88 for a yearly subscription will be charged in
                this case.{" "}
              </p>
              <h3>Cancellation</h3>
              <p>
                SUBSCRIPTION FEE CHARGES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO
                REFUNDS OR CREDIT FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS. After
                a cancellation, you will continue to have access to the
                discounts throughout the end of your billing cycle. To cancel
                your subscription, access the Payment section by clicking on the
                setting icon in the upper right-hand corner of your account
                page, for a dropdown menu. After cancelation, the subscription
                will be active until its expiration date but will not be
                auto-renewed. Please note that you must unsubscribe before the
                next billing cycle to avoid charges for the following month or
                year. Kryptomerch Subscription fee charges cannot be refunded.
                We can only charge your payment cards for the Premium plan
                subscription and cannot use your Kryptomerch balance instead.
                Kryptomerch Premium does not automatically get cancelled when
                you disconnect your Kryptomerch store or uninstall the
                Kryptomerch app. It must be manually canceled from the Payment
                section to stop all subscription charges.{" "}
